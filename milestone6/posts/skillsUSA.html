                <h2>2nd Place at the SkillsUSA State Electronics Technology Competition!</h2>
                <p>Hey everyone!</p>
                <p>I'm thrilled to share some awesome news — I placed <strong>2nd</strong> in the <strong>SkillsUSA State Competition</strong> for Electronics Technology!</p>
                <p>This competition was a serious challenge. It tested everything from circuit building and troubleshooting to electronics theory and problem-solving under pressure. I went up against a lot of skilled competitors, and every part of the event pushed me to stay sharp and focused.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights was the hands-on troubleshooting event. We had to find hidden faults in a broken circuit, fix them, and get everything working again — all under a time limit. It was intense but incredibly fun!</p>
                <p>When they called my name for 2nd place, it felt amazing. All the hours spent studying, building, burning out a few circuits (oops), and learning paid off. It's an experience I’ll never forget, and it’s motivating me to aim even higher next time!</p>
                <p>Thanks so much to my mentors, teachers, friends, and family who supported me along the way. This is just the beginning — there's a lot more to come on my electronics journey!</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more projects, experiments, and maybe even some tips on how I prepared for SkillsUSA!</p>
